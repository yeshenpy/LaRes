Based on the above reward function, the current RL policy’s win rate is {win_rate} and the reward from the currently designed function is {current_our_score}.
Below are the scores of the current policy on different metrics across multiple rounds during the evaluation process:
{current_output}

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the current policy has already performed well on certain metrics, the focus should shift to the subsequent tasks.
    (3) If the reward is excessively large, it may need to be appropriately scaled to avoid learning issues.
